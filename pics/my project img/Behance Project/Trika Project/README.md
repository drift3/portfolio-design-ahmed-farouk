"Treka | تريكا" is a logo specially designed to represent an Arabic sports brand characterized by strength and motion. The logo combines a football — the most popular sport — with Arabic typography in a modern geometric style that reflects identity and confidence.
The lettering was entirely hand-drawn from scratch to achieve a unique and unconventional form, blending tradition with modernity. The golden color used in the design symbolizes professionalism, energy, and excellence.


Worked on a branding project for "Trika | تريكا," a sportswear store. I was responsible for creating the visual identity, including a bilingual logo, color palette, and branded mockups.
